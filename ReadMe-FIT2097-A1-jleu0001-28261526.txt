How to play the game:

WASD movement, with mouse one (left click) to interact. Find the key to open the first door and find the switch to remotely open the next door


What works: 
- Start screen, Pause screen and End screen
- Display different item, player health and messages on screen (debug)
- Trace function works and displays information on screen (debug)
- Automatically detects when health < 0 and calls the player death event
- Player health drops at a constant rate, incorporates game states
- Simple lock and key
- Remote Unlock
- Health pickup
- Interactable objects use an appropraite interface

What doesn't work:
End screen sometimes popping in after player win
End screen retry button leading to a URL error when trying to reload level
(technically) displayinformation (since I'm using debug)
